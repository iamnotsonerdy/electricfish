/* how */

const howTxt = "It has specialized electrocytes in its tail that produce weak electric fields, which it uses to navigate its surroundings, locate prey, and communicate with other fish. Electric fish have the unique ability to generate electric fields around them using a specialized structure called an electric organ. This organ is typically located in the tails of electric fish and is made up of modified muscle or nerve cells that are capable of generating electric fields. The fields are a result of the Electric Organ Discharge (EOD), which is produced by the electric organ, as the name implies."

/* EOD */

const eodP1 = "Electric fish have the unique ability to generate electric fields around them using a specialized structure called an electric organ. This organ is typically located in the tails of electric fish and is made up of modified muscle or nerve cells that are capable of generating electric fields. The fields are a result of the Electric Organ Discharge (EOD), which is produced by the electric organ, as the name implies."

const eodP2 = "Strongly electric fish have an EOD that is powerful enough to stun their prey. Typical EOD amplitudes for these animals range from about 10 to 150 volts."

const eodP3 = "Weakly electric fish generate an EOD too weak to stun prey, but are used for navigation, object detection (electrolocation) and communication with other electric fish (electrocommunication)."

const eodP4 = "that is typically less than one volt in amplitude."

const eodSbhd = "Wave vs Pulse"

const eodwp_p1 = "Some fish, like Apteronotus, Eigenmannia, and Gymnarchus, produce electric signals that are smooth and wavy, similar to the shape of a sine wave. These signals are continuous and consistent, and are known as \"wave-type\" electric organ discharges (EODs)."

const eodwp_p2 = "Some fish species, like Gnathonemus, Gymnotus, and Raja, have a unique way of producing their electric organ discharge (EOD) waveform. Instead of a continuous waveform, their EOD consists of short pulses with longer gaps in between. This is referred to as a \"pulse-type\" EOD, as the electric discharges occur in brief bursts separated by longer pauses."

const eodwp_p3= "The figure above illustrates the different types of EOD waveforms observed in different species."

const eodwp_p4 = "Apteronotus have a wave-type EOD, with a high discharge frequency (about 1 kHz) and a weak electric field (a few mV near the fish)."

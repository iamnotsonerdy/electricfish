const landDg1 = "Apteronotus albifrons, commonly known as the black ghost knifefish or the black ghost electric fish, is a species of electric knife fish that belongs to the Apteronotidae family. It is a solitary and a nocturnal species. It is primarily a carnivorous animal and feeds on insect larvae, and small crustaceans."

const landDg2 = "Meet the black ghost knifefish, a fascinating organism with an electric sense!"

const landDg3 = "It lives in dark and murky waters and generates electric fields to navigate and communicate. "

const landDg4 = "What are electric fish?"

const landDg5 = "Some fish can produce electric fields, which makes them \"electrogenic\", while others can detect electric fields, which makes them \"electroreceptive\". Many electric fish have both of these abilities. "

const landDg6 = "The species including skates, rays, sharks, and catfish are not usually considered electric as they can only detect electric fields, but not produce them."

const howTxt7 = "An electric organ consists of multiple columns, each containing thousands of stacked electrocytes (electric cells). These cells are exclusively connected to nerves on one side, with the connected side oriented towards the fish's tail. While at rest, these cells have a positive charge on the outside and a negative charge on the inside."

const howTxt8 = "When signal arrives, the ion gates open (blue spaces) and allow the positive charges to move inside the cell."

const howTxt9 = "The movement of ions only takes place on the innervated side. Therefore, the cell is positive on one side and negative on the other which allows it to act like an electric battery."

const howTxt9 = "All the cells are innervated on only one side. This facilitates unimpeded charge movement towards the head. And then from the head to the tail, outside the body."
const howTxt10 = "All the cells receive the signal simultaneously, which facilitates the creation of an electric field around the body of the fish. This field is known as ‘ELECTRIC ORGAN DISCHARGE’."

This organ is typically located in the tails of electric fish and is made up of modified muscle or nerve cells that are capable of generating electric fields.

const eodwp_p2 = "Instead of a continuous waveform, the EOD of Gnathonemus, Gymnotus, and Raja consists of short pulses with longer gaps in between. This is referred to as a \"pulse-type\" EOD, as the electric discharges occur in brief bursts separated by longer pauses."

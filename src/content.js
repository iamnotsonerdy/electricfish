const landDg1 = "Apteronotus albifrons, commonly known as the black ghost knifefish or the black ghost electric fish, is a species of electric knife fish that belongs to the Apteronotidae family. It is a solitary and a nocturnal species. It is primarily a carnivorous animal and feeds on insect larvae, and small crustaceans."

const landDg2 = "Did you know that just like humans have different senses, such as sight and hearing, the black ghost knifefish has an electric sense? Meet the black ghost knifefish, a fascinating creature with an electric sense! Unlike us, it generates electric fields to navigate and communicate with other fish, especially in the dark and murky waters it calls home. "

const landDg3 = "This extraordinary sense is well-developed and gives the knifefish an edge in adapting to its environment. "

const landDg4 = "Some fish can produce electric fields, which makes them \"electrogenic\", while others can detect electric fields, which makes them \"electroreceptive\"."

const landDg5 = "Many electric fish have both of these abilities. However, some fish species like skates, rays, sharks, and catfish can only detect electric fields, but not produce them. As a result, they are not usually considered electric fish."

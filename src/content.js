const landDg3 = "Some fish can produce electric fields, which makes them \"electrogenic\", while others can detect electric fields, which makes them \"electroreceptive\"."

const howTxt = "An electric organ consists of multiple columns, each containing thousands of stacked electrocytes (electric cells). These cells are exclusively connected to nerves on one side, with the connected side oriented towards the fish's tail.While at rest, these cells have a positive charge on the outside and a negative charge on the inside."

const howTxt = "When signal arrives, the ion gates open (blue spaces) and allow the positive charges to move inside the cell."

const howTxt = "The movement of ions only takes place on the innervated side. Therefore, the cell is positive on one side and negative on the other which allows it to act like an electric battery."

const howTxt = "All the cells are innervated on only one side. This facilitates unimpeded charge movement towards the head. And then from the head to the tail, outside the body."

const howTxt = "All the cells receive the signal simultaneously, which facilitates the creation of an electric field around the body of the fish. This field is known as ‘ELECTRIC ORGAN DISCHARGE’."

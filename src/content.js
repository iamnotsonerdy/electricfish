const landDg1 = "Some fish have a unique ability to generate electric fields, making them \"electrogenic,\" while others can detect electric fields, making them \"electroreceptive.\" Most electric fish possess both of these abilities. There are several fish species, such as skates, rays, sharks, and catfish, that are electroreceptive, but not electrogenic. As a result, they are not typically referred to as electric fish."

const landDg2 = "Apteronotus albifrons, commonly known as the black ghost knifefish or the black ghost electric fish, is a species of electric knifefish that belongs to the Apteronotidae family."

const landDg3 = "Similar to how humans have different senses like sight and hearing, the black ghost knifefish has an electric sense. It can generate electric fields which it uses for navigation and communication with other fish. This specialized sense is well-developed and allows the fish to adapt in the dark and murky waters it inhabits."

const landDg4 = "Apteronotus albifrons is a solitary and a nocturnal species. It is primarily carnivorous and feeds on insect larvae, and small crustaceans."

/* how */

const howTxt = "It has specialized electrocytes in its tail that produce weak electric fields, which it uses to navigate its surroundings, locate prey, and communicate with other fish. Electric fish have the unique ability to generate electric fields around them using a specialized structure called an electric organ. This organ is typically located in the tails of electric fish and is made up of modified muscle or nerve cells that are capable of generating electric fields. The fields are a result of the Electric Organ Discharge (EOD), which is produced by the electric organ, as the name implies."

The fields are a result of the Electric Organ Discharge (EOD), which is produced by the electric organ, as the name implies."

const eodP2 = "Strongly electric fish have an EOD that is powerful enough to stun their prey. Typical EOD amplitudes for these animals range from about 10 to 150 volts."

const eodSbhd = "Wave vs Pulse"

const eodwp_p1 = "Some fish, like Apteronotus, Eigenmannia, and Gymnarchus, produce electric signals that are smooth and wavy, similar to the shape of a sine wave. These signals are continuous and consistent, and are known as \"wave-type\" electric organ discharges (EODs)."

const eodwp_p2 = "Some fish species, like Gnathonemus, Gymnotus, and Raja, have a unique way of producing their electric organ discharge (EOD) waveform. Instead of a continuous waveform, their EOD consists of short pulses with longer gaps in between. This is referred to as a \"pulse-type\" EOD, as the electric discharges occur in brief bursts separated by longer pauses."

const eodwp_p3= "The figure above illustrates the different types of EOD waveforms observed in different species."

const eodwp_p4 = "Apteronotus have a wave-type EOD, with a high discharge frequency (about 1 kHz) and a weak electric field (a few mV near the fish)."
